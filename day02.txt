1.Difference between Browser JS(console) v Nodejs 
 
  JS	                 
  -Javascript is a programming language that is used for writing scripts on the website.	 
  -Javascript can only run in browse	
  -It is basically used on the client-side	
  -Javascript can run in any browser engine as like JS core in safari and Spidermonkey in Firefox. 
  -Javascript used in front end development	

  Nodejs
  -Nodejs is a Javascript runtime environment
  -We can run javascript outside the browser with the help of nodejs
  -It is mostly used on the server-side
  -V8 is the Javascript engine inside of node.js that parses and runs Javascript.
  -Nodejs is used in server-side development


2.Summary
 -The browser gets our HTML, that intern requests all the dependencies, insert magic, other things happen and then we have our site rendered. 

 -When the HTML is  fetched it is Parsed and fetches the CSS,  JS and Image path links then does a Multi Threaded second request and downloads them all. 

 -The CSS and the HTML really have no correlation within the browser with exception to only their relative class and id names. The CSS contains the Markup Rules and Attributes for the add_tag() methods and the GUI

 -All HTML tags then become add_tag() methods for the Canvas Markup. These also in a for loop are stripped leaving only the render-able text pre-placed onto the screen but without config_tag() methods.

 -were first designed to allow website masters to implement injected Advertising into the browsers. This language gradually became less advertising and more dynamic as it grew.
